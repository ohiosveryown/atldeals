The Braves offer Value Pack tickets, which comes with a $10 credit to use on food or drinks at the game! I personally used mine towards an H&F burger!

**Use the promo code:VALUE**

*For example: For Friday's game the cheapest tickets are $27.35 after fees, but with the value pack you pay $28.50 after fee and get $10 to use at the game!*
