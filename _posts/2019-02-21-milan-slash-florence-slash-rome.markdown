Back in October of 2018, I was able to **travel to Italy on credit cards points**! 2 Delta Round Trip Tickets to Milan for 68,112 Chase Ultimate Rewards points (34,056 per person)

I recommend using Chase points for **travel**! Yes, you could redeem them for cash (50,000 = $500) BUT they're worth SO much more when redeemed for travel. *Further explained below*

## ![chase points (2).png](/uploads/chase%20points%20(2).png)

**1.** **[Chase Ink Business Preferred](https://www.referyourchasecard.com/21a/TEGDXXFDPB)** is one of the best offers out right now!

**80,000 points with $5,000 spend.**

* I met the $5000 spending requirement by using Venmo. There’s a 3% fee on Venmo for using a credit card ($150) but in the end received the 80,000 bonus and 5,150 points from $5000 in total Venmo transactions. Total of 85,150 points that cost $150 in fees and $95 for the annual fee on the card. This definitely isn’t the most efficient way, but I was in a rush for points as I wanted to go to Italy the next month.

* Yes, it’s a business credit card and a business can be anything from selling things eBay, Facebook Marketplace etc! You can find more information on business credit cards [here!](https://www.reddit.com/r/churning/wiki/index#wiki_how_to_get_a_business_card_without_a_business.3F)

**2.** **[Chase Sapphire Reserve](https://creditcards.chase.com/rewards-credit-cards/chase-sapphire-reserve)** was one of my favorite cards!

**50,000 points with $4,000 spend.**

* I personally met this spend by opening 1 PNC checking account (funding the PNC account with $2,000 from the credit card) and two BMO Harris Checking accounts. [More info on funding bank accounts with credit cards.](https://www.doctorofcredit.com/does-funding-a-bank-account-with-a-credit-card-count-as-a-purchase-or-cash-advance/)

* Unfortunately BMO no longer allows credit card funding, so I recommend opening a Wells Fargo Account for $500 in credit card funding! And don’t forget the [$400 Wells Fargo Checking Bank Bonus](https://atl.deals/WellsFargo)
  And First Home Bank that allows $1,500 in credit card funding as a “purchase” then just pay off the card with your deposit! Apply online and not in branch!

* This card has a **$450 annual fee**. SO worth it! It comes with $300 in travel credit per year. Personally, I used the [$300 travel credit](https://www.doctorofcredit.com/300-chase-sapphire-reserve-travel-credit-work-triggers/) collectively throughout the first year, and the second year I used the $300 in the first month and then CHANGED THE CARD to the Chase Freedom card (which has no annual fee), so the second year $450 annual fee was refunded and I still got the second $300 travel credit for that first month. For a total of $600 travel credit and only paid the first $450 annual fee)

***Reasons this card is amazing:***

* **Priority Pass access!** (Gives you and 2 guests access to airport lounges around the world! Free food and drinks (beer, wine, cocktails) at the airport!

* Can redeem points through the Chase portal for 1.5x (50,000 points turns into 75,000 points for travel)

**3.** There's also the [Chase Sapphire Preferred](https://creditcards.chase.com/rewards-credit-cards/chase-sapphire-preferred). Which is 60,000 points and the same spending requirement with a $95/year, you can also change the card to the Freedom after a year to avoid the fee.

* 1.25x point redemption for travel through the portal

* None of the benefits mentioned above

Last year, I got both the Sapphire Reserve and Sapphire Preferred Cards, but they only allow 1 Sapphire card per person now. So choose the on that best fits you!

Yes, you could redeem them for cash (50,000 = $500) BUT they're worth SO much more when redeemed for travel. You can transfer points to airlines / hotels or redeem through the Chase portal.

For my Italy trip, I used the Chase portal to redeem points for 1.5x.

I have also transferred points to Hyatt for an upcoming Cancun trip. (For example: 25,000 Points is 1 night at this [all-inclusive resort in Cancun](https://www.hyatt.com/en-US/hotel/mexico/hyatt-zilara-cancun/cunia), which runs \+$500/ night. So, instead of redeeming 25,000 points for cash ($250) you get over $500 value in travel!
