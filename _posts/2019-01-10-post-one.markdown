## **Hello friends! Welcome to Atlanta Daily Deals!**

This website is intended to be a guide for Atlanta residents to take advantage of free offers, deals, and even make a little side income.

Now a little about me...I grew up in the Atlanta area and currently work in Investment Management in the Atlanta area. I did my first **Bank Bonus** in Feb 2017 and this little hobby took off. In the first year, I made more than $7,000 from bank bonuses alone and fell love with the hobby.

Bank Bonuses take a lot of organization and I have put together [an Introduction](https://atl.deals/bankbonuses) for those interested.

Outside of Bank Bonuses - **Free Stuff** and **Deals** are a couple of my favorite things. I will be posting these offers on the site as well.
