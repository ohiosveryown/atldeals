Hilton Honors members (free to join) can get a vacation in Hawaii, New York, Las Vegas or Orlando **and** 50,000 bonus points from $199 to $699.

* 4-day/3-night stay for $199 plus tax in Orlando

* 4-day/3-night stay for $199 plus tax in Las Vegas, Nevada

* 3-day/2-night stay for $299 plus tax in New York City, New York

* 6-day/5-night stay for $699 plus tax in Honolulu or Waikoloa, Hawaii

**This is such a good deal because there's a slight catch - you need to sit through a two hour timeshare presentation / sales pitch while you're there-**

* *Make sure you're a person that doesn't get persuaded easily and signs up for a timeshare during this presentation*

If you call the number listed on the website you may be able to get an even better deal!
