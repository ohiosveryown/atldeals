In March 2019, I was able to **travel to New York City on credit cards points**! 2 Delta Round Trip Tickets to NYC for 17,000 Skymiles per person.

## **How to:**

Currently Delta is running a promotion for 60,000 Skymiles after spending $2,000 in the first 3 months.

### **Hotel**

Additionally, we were able to stay at the Embassy Suites in Midtown Manhattan, next to Times Square, for 58,000 Hilton Honors Points per night. (See credit card offers below) Personally, I love Embassy Suites since they offer free breakfast and free Happy Hour from 5-7! *Although there are many other hotels for less points in the area!*
