In March of 2019, I was able to **travel to Cancun on credit cards points**! The first of many all-inclusive vacations; there's nothing better than laying in a cabana on the beach with unlimited food and alcohol.

The cost of [the Hyatt Ziva Cancun](https://www.hyatt.com/en-US/hotel/mexico/hyatt-ziva-cancun/canif) runs **\~$500\+/night**, but here's how to stay for little to no cost...

## **How to:**

This trip took 2 credit card bonuses to fund: [the Hyatt Credit Card](https://www.referyourchasecard.com/205/DC04ED4R6K) and [the Chase Ink Business Preferred](https://www.referyourchasecard.com/21a/TEGDXXFDPB).

Before you dismiss the credit card bonus because of the spending requirement - there are many ways to [manufacture spend](https://frequentmiler.boardingarea.com/manufactured-spending-complete-guide/) on credits cards, so you're not actually "spending" $6,000 just to get the credit card bonus.

## **Redemption**

Most Hyatt all-inclusive resorts are 25,000 points/ night. The Hyatt credit card sign up bonus covers the first two nights. The second card can be any of the 3 Chase cards mentioned below. 50,000 Chase UR points will cover the last two days.

Yes, you could redeem Chase UR points for cash (50,000 = $500) BUT they're worth SO much more when transferring the points to Hyatt. Transferring 50,000 points to Hyatt covers 2 nights at the all-inclusive (valued at over $1,000).

**1.** **[Chase Ink Business Preferred](https://www.referyourchasecard.com/21a/TEGDXXFDPB)** is one of the best offers out right now!

**80,000 points with $5,000 spend.**

* I met the $5000 spending requirement by using Venmo. There’s a 3% fee on Venmo for using a credit card ($150) but in the end received the 80,000 bonus and 5,150 points from $5000 in total Venmo transactions. Total of 85,150 points that cost $150 in fees and $95 for the annual fee on the card.

* Yes, it’s a business credit card and a business can be anything from selling things eBay, Facebook Marketplace etc! You can find more information on business credit cards [here!](https://www.reddit.com/r/churning/wiki/index#wiki_how_to_get_a_business_card_without_a_business.3F)

**2.** **[Chase Sapphire Reserve](https://creditcards.chase.com/rewards-credit-cards/chase-sapphire-reserve)** was one of my favorite cards!

**50,000 points with $4,000 spend.**

* I personally met this spend by funding checking accounts with the credit cards as "purchases" [More info on funding bank accounts with credit cards.](https://www.doctorofcredit.com/does-funding-a-bank-account-with-a-credit-card-count-as-a-purchase-or-cash-advance/)

* This card has a **$450 annual fee**. SO worth it! It comes with $300 in travel credit per year. Personally, I used the [$300 travel credit](https://www.doctorofcredit.com/300-chase-sapphire-reserve-travel-credit-work-triggers/) collectively throughout the first year, and the second year I used the $300 in the first month and then CHANGED THE CARD to the Chase Freedom card (which has no annual fee), so the second year $450 annual fee was refunded and I still got the second $300 travel credit for that first month. For a total of $600 travel credit and only paid the first $450 annual fee)

***Reasons this card is amazing:***

* **Priority Pass access!** (Gives you and 2 guests access to airport lounges around the world! Free food and drinks (beer, wine, cocktails) at the airport!

* Can redeem points through the Chase portal for 1.5x (50,000 points turns into 75,000 points for travel)

**3.** There's also the [Chase Sapphire Preferred](https://creditcards.chase.com/rewards-credit-cards/chase-sapphire-preferred). 60,000UR points with the same spending requirement with **no annual fee the first year** ($95/year after, can also change the card to the Freedom after a year to avoid the fee).

* 1.25x point redemption for travel through the portal

* None of the benefits mentioned above

Last year, I got both the Sapphire Reserve and Sapphire Preferred Cards, but they only allow 1 Sapphire card per person now. So choose the on that best fits you! If you don't travel that often I recommend the Sapphire Preferred, if you do then go for the Reserve!

**Also, there are [other Hyatt all-inclusive locations](https://www.hyatt.com/brands/all-inclusive) and the Hyatt points can be used at multiple other locations starting at 5,000/night! 
Bon voyage!**
